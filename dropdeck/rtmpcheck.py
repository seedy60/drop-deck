"""Asking a platform whether a stream key is right, without broadcasting.

Joshua, 20 September 2026: "pressing ctrl B it says it's going live to youtube
but nothing shows on my channel, i have the stream key and channel name in the
settings like it said to do."

Until this file existed, Drop Deck could not answer that. **Test the
connection** checked that the address resolved, that the port accepted a
socket and that TLS completed, and then said so in as many words: it "cannot
tell you whether the key itself is right". So the one thing a presenter needs
to know before a show was the one thing the button could not say, and the only
way to find out was to go on the air and look at a page they cannot see.

Why this is a separate RTMP client and not two lines of PyAV
------------------------------------------------------------

`RtmpDestination.connect` already proves a key: a wrong one is refused there.
It cannot be borrowed, because FFmpeg does the whole of the RTMP session
inside `container.start_encoding()` and then, in the same call and with no way
to stop in between, writes the FLV header, onMetaData and both codec sequence
headers. That is data on the wire.

**And the entire safety argument rests on sending no data.** YouTube's API
reference defines a stream as `active` when "the user is receiving data via
the stream", and a broadcast cannot be transitioned to testing or live while
the stream it is bound to is inactive: "The requested transition is not
allowed when the stream that is bound to the broadcast is inactive." Auto
start is that same transition. So a publish carrying no media never makes the
stream active, never starts a broadcast, creates no watch page, notifies
nobody and leaves nothing on the channel. **What nobody publishes is whether
YouTube counts an FLV header and two sequence headers as data.** So they are
not sent. Not one byte after the publish command.

Facebook is safe for a plainer reason: nothing is posted there until somebody
presses Go Live Now, which is what the app's help has said all along.

So this speaks RTMP as far as the publish response and stops:

    handshake     C0/C1 out, S0/S1/S2 in, C2 out. The simple version.
    connect       and read the _result.
    releaseStream and FCPublish, which the video platforms expect and which
                  a smaller server ignores. Neither is waited for.
    createStream  and read the stream id out of the _result.
    publish       and read the onStatus. THAT is the answer.
    deleteStream  and hang up.

The counterpart is `tools/mock_rtmp.py`, which is the same protocol from the
other end and is what the checks in `tests/test_3_8_4.py` talk to, so none of
this needs the internet or anybody's channel to be tested.

**Nothing here raises.** Every failure is a `Result` naming what happened in
words a presenter can act on, the same rule `secrets.py` follows and for the
same reason: somebody who cannot see the screen cannot read a traceback out
of a status bar.
