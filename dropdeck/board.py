        drive that was only unplugged today with a same named file that
        happened to be nearby. Each computer looks again when it opens the
        board, which costs at most `C.BESIDE_SEARCH_SECONDS`.

        **Exact file names only.** No name without its extension, which
        turned a missing applause.wav into a different applause.flac, and no
        file for a folder.

        **The window is never held longer than the bound**, whatever the
        disk does: the look runs on a thread of its own and is abandoned if
        it has not answered in time, because one folder on a sleeping network
