"""3.8.3: a microphone key that can never do nothing, a board that is never
lost, and program sources that come back by themselves.

    python tests/test_3_8_3.py

Three reports, 19 September 2026.

**Mashal, relayed by Tony:** Ctrl+M did nothing at all, on or off. Installed
and portable, after a restart, privacy settings checked, nobody else seeing
it. The app had no way to say why, because nothing was looking: a key taken
by another program never arrives, a fault inside the handler vanished into a
console a released copy does not have, and a microphone that opens and sends
silence looked exactly like one that works.

**fb40, a Windows user on 3.8.2:** "if I rename, move or copy the json file,
it acts as if it was never set up." Every start opened board.json and nothing
else; closing the app saved over a board copied in while it was open; and a
board that would not load was replaced by the demo, which then took its path.

**Tony:** a program source did not come back when Chrome was opened again.
A capture belongs to one process, and nothing went looking for the new one.

The real keystroke is pressed by `tools/check_video_key.py mic` and
`tools/check_video_key.py micalt`. Nothing in here can replace that: this
file proves the wiring and the words, not the key.
