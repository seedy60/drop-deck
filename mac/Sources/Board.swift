//
//   1. Anything this build does not recognise is kept and written back out.
//      A board saved here must never lose the streaming server, the microphone
//      chain or anything else the Windows copy owns and this one has not
//      reached yet.
//   2. Where a value cannot mean the same thing on both platforms, the Mac one
//      gets a key of its own rather than overwriting the Windows one. The slot
//      hotkeys are the case that matters: key_code and modifiers are wx's, and
//      mac_key_code and mac_modifiers sit beside them.
