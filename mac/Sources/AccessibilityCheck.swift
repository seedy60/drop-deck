// `--check-accessibility`. The shell the checks run from cannot be given the
// Accessibility permission, so System Events cannot read this app from the
// outside. This reads it from the inside instead: the real windows and panels
// are built exactly as the app builds them, never shown, and every element is
// walked through the NSAccessibility protocol (isAccessibilityElement,
// accessibilityRole, accessibilityLabel, accessibilityTitle,
// accessibilityTitleUIElement, accessibilityValue, accessibilityChildren),
// which is what VoiceOver itself is handed.
//
// What it refuses:
//
//   - a control you can reach and work (a button, a check box, a popup, a
//     text box, a slider, a stepper, a table, a control inside a table cell)
//     that has no spoken name. VoiceOver says "button" and nothing else, which
//     is a control that does not exist for the person this app is for;
//   - the running order saying anything but the truth about a tick (Siena,
//     9 September 2026);
//   - a menu item with no title, or the go live and microphone keys not being
//     where the manual says they are.
//
// And it warns about two controls of the same kind with the same name on the
// same page, which VoiceOver cannot tell apart either.
//
// Nothing real is touched. The board is built in memory, the data folder is a
// scratch folder, the keychain is not read, nothing is announced, and no
// microphone, camera, screen capture or network is opened: panels that would
// wait for a person are handed to the check by `ModalAudit` instead of run.
