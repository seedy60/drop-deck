// saved over a board copied in while the app was open, the very act of
// picking the copy up; and a board that would not load was replaced by the
// demo, which then took its path and was autosaved over it.

// This file is the policy, kept apart from the window so every decision in it
// can be asserted on real files in a scratch folder: which board opens, what
