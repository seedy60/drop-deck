// Recording the picture as well as the sound, in sync, to one file.
//
// A mirror of dropdeck/videorecord.py. Tony, 10 September 2026: "in addition to
// taking audio, it also takes video as well. ensure it is perfectly in sync
// with audio." Darrell, a listener, the same day: "when setting up a video
// source, such as a camera or capture card, should you not be able to record in
// video if you are doing a recording test?"
//
// Command+R still records sound alone and is untouched. Command+Shift+R records
// both, and neither needs you to be on air.
//
// ## The clock, which is the whole feature
//
// **The audio sample clock is master and video absorbs every bit of drift.**
// Master is this recorder's own count of samples written to the file,
// `framesWritten / sampleRate`, which came off the sound card through the
// `AirBus`. Video is emitted until its frame count reaches
// `Int(audioSeconds * fps)`, so a camera running slow has a frame repeated and
// one running fast has a frame skipped, and neither can move the timeline.
// **No part of this file may ever timestamp anything from a wall clock**, and
// the self test asserts that by reading this source.
//
// That is the same mechanism `VideoStreamer.pumpVideo` already uses. Tiffany
// measured the Windows version holding sync to 0.00 ms per minute over a real
// 45 second recording, with a per frame stamp read back out of the decoded
// picture. She also measured what happens if any part of it takes its time from
// the wall clock instead, on a card running 0.3 per cent off: **minus 150 ms
// per minute**. That is the worst mistake available here and it is one line
// away at all times.
//
// ## Three things that are right for a socket and wrong for a file
//
// The RTMP path is correct where it lives. Copying it wholesale is not.
//
// 1. **The time base.** FLV carries millisecond timestamps, so the stream
//    stamps `frames * 1000 / fps` at 1/1000. On Windows that gave real frame
//    intervals of 33.312, 33.313 and 33.375 ms in an MP4: a variable frame rate
//    file, which is a nuisance in an editor. Here every frame is stamped
//    `CMTime(value: framesSent, timescale: fps)`, which is exact by
//    construction and cannot round at all.
// 2. **A missing picture.** Returning without sending is correct for a socket,
//    where a missed frame is simply not sent. In a file it stalls the video
//    timeline while audio keeps going. Measured on Windows over an eight second
//    camera outage: **the picture ran 6.48 seconds ahead of the sound**, was
//    still 0.48 seconds out sixteen seconds later, and nothing was dropped, no
//    gap appeared, no count was wrong and nothing was logged anywhere. Here a
//    missing picture repeats the last frame, which is also cheaper.
// 3. **The rate control.** `VideoEncoder` uses `ConstantBitRate` because a
//    platform publishes a bitrate FLOOR and pads up to it with filler. A file
//    has no floor and no reason to carry filler, so this asks for an AVERAGE
//    bitrate instead. Windows reaches the same place with CRF, which
//    VideoToolbox has no equivalent of.
//
// ## Why the file is fragmented
//
// A plain MP4 keeps its index in a moov atom written at the end, so a crash
// leaves a file that will not open at all. `movieFragmentInterval` makes
// AVAssetWriter write the index as it goes, so a three hour show that stops
// unexpectedly loses its last second rather than all of it. Windows measured
// the same trade at minus 0.04 per cent in bytes, the fragment headers being
// smaller than the index they replace.
